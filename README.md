# TexturePackerJsonPipeline
A custom MonoGame Content Pipeline based on the one written by MonoGame.Extended, modified to provide all relevant info from TexturePacker's JSON spritesheet atlas. Includes rotation and trimmed information to ensure your sprites display properly with maximally-optimizied spritesheets.
